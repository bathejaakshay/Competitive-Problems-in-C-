#### DP Shortcut
Identification: If the question asks to count something or find minimum or maximum from all the ways possible then its recursion.

Steps:
1. Try to represent the problems in terms of index.
2. Do all possible stuff on the index according to the problem.
3. For count all the ways -> sum up all the stuff
4. If mini of all the ways -> find minimum of all stuff. Same for maximum

#### 1. kth Fibbonacci number

**Approach 1** Memoization: (Top Down)
```
int fibbo(n){
  if(n<=1) return 1;
  if(dp[n]!=-1) return dp[n];
  
  dp[n] = dp[n-1] + dp[n-2];
  return dp[n];
  
}

TC: O(n)
Space : O(n) + O(n) : Aux + DP_array
```

**Approach 2** Tabular 1 : Bottom up
```
dp[0] = 0, dp[1] = 1
for(i : 2 to n):
  dp[n] = dp[n-1] + dp[n-2];


TC: O(n)
SC: O(n) : Dp array
```

**Approach 3** Tabular 2: Bottom up with only two variables

```
prev2 = 0, prev1 = 1

for(i :2 to n):
  curr_i = prev1+prev2;
  prev2=prev1;
  prev1 = curr_i;
  
ans: prev1

TC: O(n)
SC: O(1)
```

#### [2. Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/)
**Approach**
1. Given n stairs we can represent in index from 1 to n where 0 means floor and 1 to n are stairs.
2. Secondly we need to find all the ways so we return 1 in base case.
3. Now we add left and right to compute all.

```
climbst(int n)
{
  if(n<=1) return 1;
  
  int left = f(n-1);
  int right = f(n-2);
  return left+right;
}
```
The recurrsion seems like fibonacci hence we can use the same.
