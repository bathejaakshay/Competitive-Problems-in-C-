#### [1. Find Cycle in Directed Graph/ Course Schedule](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/)
**Main Idea:**  
1. We will use DFS for the cycle detection. It is not as easy as in the undirected graph in which we just check visited array and parent (if a child is already visited and is not my parent then it is a cycle)
2. In Directed graph we check for backedge. We do this by maintaining recstk array which is a bool array represented which all vertex are currently in recstk. 
3. Now for a node say x there exists a back edge if its neighbour node say y is already visited and is already in the recstk i.e recstk[y] = 1;
4. Do remember to make recstk[x] = false whenever x is popped off the recurrsion stack.
5. The following code is primarily the solution for course-schedule problem. In this if we have edge (0,1) this represent that we can take course 0 if we already have taken course 1.
6. So to take all courses, there shouldn't exist any cycle.
```
void add_edge(vector<vector<int>> &adjlist, vector<int> &prereq){
    adjlist[prereq[0]].push_back(prereq[1]);
    
}

bool dfs(vector<vector<int>> &adjlist, vector<bool> &visited, vector<bool> &recstk, int source){
    for(int &i:adjlist[source]){
        if(!visited[i]){
            visited[i] = true;
            recstk[i] = true;
            if(dfs(adjlist, visited, recstk, i)==false) return false;
        }
        else if(recstk[i] == true){ //if node is already visited and is in rec stack then back edge hence cycle hence not possible to schedule all courses so false
            return false;
        }
            recstk[i] = false;
    }
    return true;
}
class Solution {
public:
    bool canFinish(int numCourses, vector<vector<int>>& prerequisites) {
        vector<vector<int>> adjlist(numCourses);
        vector<bool> visited(numCourses);
        for(int i=0; i<prerequisites.size();i++){
            add_edge(adjlist,prerequisites[i]);
        }
        vector<bool> recstk(numCourses);
        
        for(int i=0; i<numCourses; i++){
            if(!visited[i]){
                visited[i] = true;
                recstk[i] = true;
                if(dfs(adjlist,visited,recstk,i) == false){
                    return false;
                }
                recstk[i] = false;
            }
        }
        
        return true;
        
    }
};
```
